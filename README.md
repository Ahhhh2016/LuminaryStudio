OpenGL Kongming Lantern Simulation

## Overview

This project is a real-time simulation of Kongming Lantern using OpenGL. It's an immersive visualization that incorporates advanced graphics techniques to realistically portray this traditional Chinese lantern.

## Features

- **Mesh File for Lantern Structure**: The main body of the lantern is constructed from a loaded mesh file, providing intricate details and realistic geometry.
- **Particle System for Flame**: The heart of the lantern, the flame, is simulated using a dynamic particle system, creating a lifelike and ever-changing fire effect.
- **Textured Surfaces**: To enhance realism, the lantern's surface is textured, capturing the traditional aesthetic of Kongming Lanterns.
- **Physics Simulation**: The simulation includes physical effects like gravity and wind, allowing the lantern to interact realistically with its environment.
- **Water Simulation**: A reflective and interactive water surface adds depth and realism to the simulation, enhancing the overall visual experience.
- **Skybox**: A 360-degree skybox surrounds the scene, providing a realistic and immersive background that complements the lantern's flight.
